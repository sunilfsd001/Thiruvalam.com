    <h2 class="headfont">Legends associated with the name</h2>
    <p class="legend">
      According to local legend, the name Thiruvalam derives from a divine narrative involving Lord Vinayaka (Ganesha) and his brother Muruga. When the two deities competed to circle the cosmos, Ganesha cleverly circumambulated his parents, Shiva and Parvati, thus winning the race. In Tamil, <strong>valam</strong> signifies "to go around" or "to circumambulate." This sacred place, commemorating Ganesha's act of reverence, became known as Thiru (sacred) + valam (circumambulation), eventually evolving into the names Thiruvallam and Thiruvalam.
